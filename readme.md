so I have updated the source files but not uploaded them (or the patch and zips)
because the fixes I did were SUPPOSED to make it so that you can die when your HPreaches zero
<it did not> so I didn't change anything
I think I might try the death-explorer patch and see if I can at least get it to KILL you when HP is zero
Something to do with the hplast part of SECOND_CHANCE code, so either I remove second chance...
Because TWO amulets of life saving that are identical? no... If one just puts your HP back to previous value...
I.e. hplast = 7 monster hits for 8 points of damage you get a second chance with hp at 7 again and one saves your life 
putting you at hpmax That would be ok.

But maybe adding the death (create no bones) do you want to enter explorer mode patch will work...
Only time will tell.
At least this has been semi ported to slashem with AmyBSOD's help 
(when I couldn't figure out unix patch format or NH3.1.3 to slashem or nethack to slashem I just copied her code)
If this works eventually I will be glad because then people can patch that slashem with Geek already in it.
