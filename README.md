# SlashTNG
SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F3 with pretty much most of the next generation patched to it

I took the horrible shar file from j. ali's page (www.juiblex.co.uk/nethack/TNG.html) which can NOT be unshar'ed by any means on
 windows and with the help of AmyBSOD's integration of it into her game, I coded it into slashem.
Only things I couldn't get to work was the reroll and minimum attributes 
(would really like to add it but can't figure out how to port it)
And the Stormbringer doesn't draw vortexes.
