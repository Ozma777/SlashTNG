# SlashTNG
SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F3 with pretty much most of the next generation patched to it

Exploding wands fixed but wand of bugging STILL crashes the game, not sure why....BUG #1 of hopefully 1
Rerolls and force attributes works!

I took the horrible shar file from j. ali's page (www.juiblex.co.uk/nethack/TNG.html) which can NOT be unshar'ed by any means on
 windows and with the help of AmyBSOD's integration of it into her game, I coded it into slashem.
The Stormbringer doesn't draw vortexes. (minor thing maybe someone who knows how to do this could fix)
:isn't really essential though the rumors file has been changed to accomodate the Stormbringer ACTUALLY drawing vortecies.
