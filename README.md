# SlashTNG
SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F3 with pretty much all of the next generation patched to it

Rerolls and force attributes works!

Exploding wands of bugging and probably wonder SHOULD do damage to the character, BUT coding either like exploding create horde or even adding dmg *= 2; under it crashes the game
perhaps I could maybe do an expltype first before dmg *= 2; but I didn't try it.

I took the horrible shar file from j. ali's page (www.juiblex.co.uk/nethack/TNG.html) which can NOT be unshar'ed by any means on
 windows and with the help of AmyBSOD's integration of it into her game, I coded it into slashem.
The Stormbringer doesn't draw vortexes. (minor thing maybe someone who knows how to do this could fix)
:isn't really essential though the rumors file has been changed to accomodate the Stormbringer ACTUALLY drawing vortecies.
