# SlashTNG
SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F3 with pretty much most of the next generation patched to it

HOLD OFF on downloading this.....I am not sure if nethack (or nethack 3.1.3) has explode code for wands (and boiling code for potions) but these have GOT to be fixed before I release this.

I'll fix the exploding wand of bugging (crash to desktop) thing and then REBUILD to REPLACE the windows precompiled binary
update the source-master rar and the source code here.

THEN I'll post back when it's done and email some people that it (the source and precompiled win32 binary) is finished.....

check back in a few days (I want to get this right)

I took the horrible shar file from j. ali's page (www.juiblex.co.uk/nethack/TNG.html) which can NOT be unshar'ed by any means on
 windows and with the help of AmyBSOD's integration of it into her game, I coded it into slashem.
Only things I couldn't get to work was the reroll and minimum attributes 
(would really like to add it but can't figure out how to port it)
And the Stormbringer doesn't draw vortexes.
