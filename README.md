# SlashTNG
SLASH'EM 0.0.7E7F3 with pretty much all of the next generation patched to it

Rerolls and force attributes works!

Only problem (in issues I think) is that often times you can't die!
So for now if you want a slashem with geek class also in which more often than not you can not die than this is for you!
(meanwhile) I am trying to get this to work but have no idea why you can't die.....
if anyone knows why please message me or fix an issue or do a pull request (PLEASE)

Exploding wands of bugging and probably wonder SHOULD do damage to the character, BUT coding either like exploding create horde or
even adding dmg *= 2; under it crashes the game
perhaps I could maybe do an expltype first before dmg *= 2; but I didn't try it.

I took the horrible shar file from j. ali's page (www.juiblex.co.uk/nethack/TNG.html) which can NOT be unshar'ed by any means on
 windows and with the help of AmyBSOD's integration of it into her game, I coded it into slashem.
The Stormbringer doesn't draw vortexes. (minor thing maybe someone who knows how to do this could fix)
:isn't really essential though the rumors file has been changed to accomodate the Stormbringer ACTUALLY drawing vortecies.


A few weeks and I WILL have semi-OzSlashem grafted into this project to create a vanilla slashem with some enhancements (NethackTNG +
others)
