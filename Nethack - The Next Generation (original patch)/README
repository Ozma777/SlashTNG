  Size	Filename

 17476	nhTNG.txt

This directory contains the sources for NetHack, the Next Generation,
a modified version of NetHack, and a text file describing the
differences with normal NetHack, version 3.1.3.

Note that the changes were made for BSD Unix, and have not been worked
out for other systems. They have not even been tested (by me, that is)
for BSD Unix itself. Executables or sources for MSDOS are not available.
