Preset for WINNT
so if your on another system set it for yours
Also I have replaced slashem and slam32d with SlashTNG (directories and game name)

THIS might have been a mistake since:
	 I don't know whether other systems' game names should be changed
 	or build directories should be changed either
		If I messed things up....sorry.
